its JS. I experimented with stats output and more but that made it unreliable. When
using js utilities, less is always more. All the simple code is in the html file, it does not call
on anything else. its JS -- so depending on your browser the code may need slight fixes. 



If you use this to make passwords for accounts, each account has different password rules. If 
your bank or whatwever does not accept all of !@#$%^&*()_+' you can remove any from
this line in the html ::

const chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+';




The password generator uses a character set that consists of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and a selection of special characters (!@#$%^&*()_+). These characters are defined in the chars variable:

const chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+';

When the user selects a password length from the drop-down menu and clicks the "Generate Password" button, the generate() function is called. This function retrieves the selected length, generates a random password using the generatePassword() function, and displays the password in the output textarea.

function generate() {
  const length = document.getElementById('length').value;
  const password = generatePassword(length);
  document.getElementById('password').value = password;
  document.getElementById('copy').style.display = 'inline-block';
}

The generatePassword() function takes the selected length as an argument and creates a password by randomly selecting characters from the chars string until the desired length is reached. The password is then returned as a string.

////////

function generatePassword(length) {
  const chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+';
  let password = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < length/8; i++) {
    password += chars.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length));
  }
  return password;
}

The Math.random() function generates a random decimal number between 0 and 1, and the Math.floor() function rounds down to the nearest integer. The product of these two functions generates a random index into the chars string, which corresponds to a randomly selected character. This character is then appended to the password string.

By using a random number generator to select characters from a pre-defined set, the resulting password is completely random and unpredictable.
