Number of possible keys = 2^256 = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936
Each key generated using this method is unique, as long as the input (i.e., the password and number) is different. Even a small change in the input will result in a completely different key, due to the avalanche effect of cryptographic hash functions. In other words, it's highly unlikely that two different inputs would produce the same key using this method. However, it's not impossible, as there is a very small probability that two different inputs could result in the same hash value (known as a hash collision). But in practice, the probability of such a collision occurring is negligible, given the large key space and the high collision resistance of the SHA256 hash function. So for all practical purposes, we can assume that each key generated using this method is unique.
